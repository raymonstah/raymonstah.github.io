This is my first post. I decided to work on my personal page a bit more, so I'm getting fancy now with Hugo as a static site generator instead of my raw HTML editing :smile: I'd like to be able to blog about stuff from time to time so maybe having a tool that helps me do that easier will motiviate me to do it more often. 

We'll see how it goes. I think it'll be cool to automate this as a build so that every time I push new content, it'll automatically deploy this site. Fingers crossed.

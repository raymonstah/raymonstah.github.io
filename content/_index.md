# Hello, my name is Raymond

I'm currently a Software Engineer at LaunchDarkly, where we're building a
feature management platform for software teams. I've been in the industry
for about five years now, and I spend most of my days writing Go code.
I like learning about new technologies and programming languages.

More recently, I've been very interested in building serverless cloud-native software.
I care a lot about performance, user experience, and simplicity.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and doing yoga.
I also have a bunch of other hobbies that I'm passionate about,
like woodworking and cooking.

Welcome to my blog, where you'll find posts about my experience with technology.

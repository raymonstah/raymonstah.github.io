		<h2>About Me:</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Raymond. I'm a Software Engineer at ZapLabs. I enjoy learning about the art of programming, best software engineering practices, and more recently, devops! I first started programming early in high school when I wanted to have an advantage in a game, so I built an autoclicker in C#. From there, I started making bots to automate tedious tasks, and the rest was history. I studied computer science at both UC Santa Cruz and UC Davis, which taught me to balance theory and practice. Since I graduated, I've been working full time in Emeryville, primarily writing consumer-facing software to make real estate agents day to day tasks simpler.</p>
		<p>During my time at Zaplabs, I've done almost everything from small bug fixes to helping break apart our monolith with microservices. More recently, I've been working on introducing newer security technologies such as JWTs and OIDC to our authentication layer.</p>

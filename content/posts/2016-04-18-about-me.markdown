Ladies and Gentlemen, allow myself to introduce myself. My name is Raymond Ho, and I'm about to graduate from UC Davis. I'm studying Computer Science there, it's pretty cool. Before Davis, I used to study at UC Santa Cruz. I transferred because I hate the beach. Just kidding, I have no clue why I transferred. I miss Santa Cruz :(

I enjoy programming, teaching beginners to code, abstract math, cool puzzles, and other subjects that encourage thinking. Thinking is also fun.

When I'm not hacking away at programming projects, I enjoy basketball, cooking, and hip-hop very much. I also like my dog, Kol. I think he likes me too.

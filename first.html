			I'm a third year Computer Science student studying at UC Davis.<br>
			I have a little bit of experience as a programmer, you know.. if conditions and for loops.<br>
			My goal is to be the world's number 0 programmer.<br>
			I've used Bootstrap for web design because programmers are lazy.<br>
			Oh yeah, I tranferred from UC Santa Cruz because I hate long walks on the beach.<br>

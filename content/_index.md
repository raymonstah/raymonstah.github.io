# Hello, my name is Raymond

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Hashicorp, working on Vault, a security product.
I've been in the industry for about seven years now. Most of my time has been spent on the backend, building distributed, fault tolerant systems, writing new web APIs, with databases, and delivering useful software to customers.

I've previously worked at:

1. ZapLabs (now Anywhere Real Estate): building a CRM for real estate agents.
2. LaunchDarkly: building enterprise feature flag software for development teams.
3. SundaeSwap: a Web3 company building a decentralized exchange for Cardano.

More recently, I've been very interested in building serverless cloud-native software.
I care a lot about performance, user experience, and simplicity.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and doing yoga.
I also have a bunch of other hobbies that I'm passionate about,
like woodworking and cooking.

Welcome to my blog, where you'll find posts about my experience with technology.

# 1. A Reliable Laptop

I understand not everybody can dish out $1000+ for a new laptop, so I have some recommendations for those of you guys on a budget.

First of all, if you already have a laptop, bring that with you! Use it until you decide that you need something better. If it gets too slow, upgrade it!

If your laptop has a spinning disk as a hard drive, you should seriously consider upgrading to a faster SSD. I recommend this one: <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OAJ412U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00OAJ412U&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=72f391f460228eb236cb2f5cbb397393">Samsung 850 EVO 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-75E250B/AM)</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00OAJ412U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I purchased two of these so far, and am extremely satisfied with their performance.

You can also upgrade the RAM in older laptops, so look into that as well. Note that not all laptops can be upgraded, so be sure to do some research on your laptop before upgrading!

If you don't already have a laptop, consider your budget. How much do you have to spend? As a general rule of thumb, you should buy the best screen on a laptop that you can afford, especially if you're a computer science student. You'll be staring at code for countless of hours, and a good  IPS display with a high screen resolution will definitely take some stress off your eyes.

Here are some of my recommendations:

## Under $400

1. Look for used Macbooks on eBay or Craigslist
2. Chromebooks! I often hear people praising the <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015806LSQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B015806LSQ&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=c176d7565ae13f95ab57c35041a52daa">Toshiba Chromebook 2 - 2015 Edition</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B015806LSQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />.

## $400 - $1000

1. <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012DTDI2C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B012DTDI2C&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=4000d5cf256e07aa0346bd36cdf91e2b">Microsoft Surface 3 Tablet</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B012DTDI2C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
2. Dell Chromebook 13.
3. <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01606KJ6C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01606KJ6C&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=748df5c4d1318ba33a6d86373105dcf0">Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (128 GB, 4 GB RAM, Intel Core i5)</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01606KJ6C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

## $1000+

At this price point, you are able to afford some of the best laptops on the market. Here are some that I recommend:

1. The Apple MacBook. Although it only has 1 port, it is a very capable and powerful machine. It will quickly compile your Java/C code if you're a Computer Science student, and unless you're editing 4K videos, this should have more than enough power for you. It's also an extremely light machine with a wonderful display! You will probably need to buy adapters or a docking station though.
<a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EIUEZ1W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01EIUEZ1W&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=27bff9c68906bf3b3ef8ac8008a32124">Apple MacBook MLHE2LL/A 12-Inch Laptop with Retina Display</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01EIUEZ1W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
2. Microsoft Surface Pro 4. This thing has great reviews and is an overall beast. I'd recommend this if you want to stick to the Windows platform, and want to take notes with a great stylus.
3. If you need absolute performance and money isn't an issue, look into the Macbook Pro w/ Retina Display or <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0163GQJOU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0163GQJOU&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=80afa18d17e913b3b2926b97e3618921">Microsoft Surface Book (128 GB, 8 GB RAM, Intel Core i5)</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0163GQJOU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

**Note:** Operating System doesn't really matter for Computer Science Students. In some classes you'll be required to run special Windows program, but those will be most likely be installed on the lab computers for you to use anyways. Some classes require to use UNIX or Linux, so a Macbook or Chromebook can be a little bit more helpful than Windows here. You should be able to SSH into your school's servers to run your programs there.

# 2. Amazon Prime

Amazon Prime is the best thing ever. Two day free shipping?! That alone is already a great investment. It will easily pay for itself within a few purchases. I prefer to shop on Amazon for majority of my purchases now. It's where I get all my electronics, school textbooks, and pretty much everything else. What's great about Amazon are the reviews and customer service.

Some items have hundreds of reviews, others have none. This is great because you will learn about common problems that other people have had with the item, which will affect your decision on whether you think it is a good purchase.

Amazon's customer service is top-notch. If your items don't get to you within their guaranteed estimate, they will often give you some store credit which can be used for movies/games/books. If the item you received is defective or broken, Amazon will often send out a replacement for it *before* you return it.

**Note:** If you're a student with a valid school email address, you can get 6 months of prime for free!

# 3. Whiteboard

I would recommend a whiteboard especially to Computer Science students because it allows you to visually solve problems. Often you'll be tracing or debugging your programs, and I found it super helpful to draw the current state of a program on a big whiteboard. It's also helpful for practicing programming questions.

Some other things you can use a whiteboard for:

* Reminders for roommates/yourself
* Psuedocode
* Drawing things

Here is one on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TQV2X8G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TQV2X8G&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=5ba59d6f1f212ac790140a1ce211131e).

# 4. External Hard Drive

If you have a ton of music, photos, and important documents, you should seriously consider an external hard drive. This will make backups a lot simpler, and data transfers a lot quicker! Harddrive prices are very low, and will preserve your memories in case your laptop crashes.

Here is one that I recommend: [WD 1TB Black My Passport Ultra Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W8XXRPM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00W8XXRPM&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=788550f64fbb78e758400c5b293b9389).

**Note:** Do not rely on your external hard drive as your *only* source of a backup. Consider using cloud services in addition to your external hard drive such as iCloud, Google Drive, or OneDrive, depending on the platform you prefer or are familiar with.

# 5. Good Pair of Headphones or Speakers

Everybody deserves good sound. If you're using the included headphones that came with your phone, you should definitely upgrade!

For $100 dollars, you can get:

1. <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FEEY9A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004FEEY9A&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=29a743fc2792064d554c93a7e78efc10">Sennheiser HD 558 Headphones</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B004FEEY9A" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> for personal use.
2. <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ULRFQ1A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ULRFQ1A&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=2b2368e56b4b5bf3d78d6d354c266ed4">Lepy LP-2024A+ Hi-Fi Audio Amplifier Stereo Power Amplifier Car Amplifier with Power Supply, 3A Power</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00ULRFQ1A" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> + A Good set of Bookshelf Speakers like these: <a  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IUIV4A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009IUIV4A&linkCode=as2&tag=raymondtaught-20&linkId=5812b15e5eb0772824d5ef76b86f3198">Micca MB42 Bookshelf Speakers With 4-Inch Carbon Fiber Woofer and Silk Dome Tweeter (Black, Pair)</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=raymondtaught-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B009IUIV4A" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. This should be more than enough for your dorm parties and movie nights.
